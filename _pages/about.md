Hi, my name is Aiko and this is my playground.

I'm married with an gorgeous wife, got 2 daughters, living in suburb of a small city and I'm working for Trumpf Machines Austria

After secondary school, I made a technical training as mechanical engineer. With my knowledge I worked as a CNC application engineer for [WFL](https://www.wfl.at). I traveled around the World (Canada, Polen, China, ...).

Then my wife got pregnant with our first girl and the next project should be 6 months in the US. So I quit my job and was looking for something new.

Since 2016 I'm working at [Trumpf Austria](https://www.trumpf.com) in the software development.
I'm working in a small team where we started with 3 people and growth to 5.  

In this small team, everyone is doing nearly everything but my main tasks are the qualification of the new offline programming system, evaluate if our system will work in the cloud for the customer, data analysis and machine learning of course.

Knownledge:
- C#
- Python
- Linux OS (Arch, ...)
- ...
