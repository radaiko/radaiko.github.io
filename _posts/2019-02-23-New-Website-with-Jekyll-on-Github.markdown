Puhh, that was not an easy job to setup a **jekyll** page with an free custom design (**minimal-mistakes**) on github pages.

Installing ***jekyll*** is easy, just follow this [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)  
Then I setup a page under my src folder ***C:\local\src\radaiko.github.io***

### The repo
Creating a repo on Github where the repo name is the ***username*** followed by ***github.io***  
In my case its ***radaiko.github.io*** and initial it with the already created folder ***C:\local\src\radaiko.github.io***

### Finding a theme
The first problem was finding a theme which will work for a personal website with github pages. I decide to use the [minimal-mistake](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) from Michael Rose.  
After installation my website was empty and nothing worked.

### Setup the minimal-mistakes theme
The best way is to read [this](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/#) and follow along.

In short change the **_conf.yml**.  
Setup a navigation.
Setup pages for about, archive, ...

As an example you can look in the github repo of this [side](https://github.com/radaiko/radaiko.github.io)
